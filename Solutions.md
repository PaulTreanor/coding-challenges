# Testing 
For test driven development consider:
- Do you understand the problem
- Define a function signiture
- Write a basic test case
- Write an edge test case 



### Strings 

- To add something to the end of a string, just concatentate the string:

```js
reversedString = reversedString + index[i]
```
