Public repo of coding challenges practice

I'm trying out doing all the old fashioned interview coding questions in a browser based IDE (CodeSpaces). I just want to get a handle on how far along these environments are for developing in. 

All coding challenges will be written in TypeScript. I'm going to make an effort to use **Deno and Node** and document how I feel about them all. 

I'll also be using a **test driven development** approach to these tests. 

I'm also going to be **documenting** all solutions in [Solutions.md](./Solutions.md)

## Week 1: Basic Challenges

### ~~Day 1: Hello World~~
- ~~Write a function that prints "Hello, World!"~~
- ~~Write tests to ensure that the function correctly prints "Hello, World!"~~

### ~~Day 2: Sum of Two Numbers~~
- ~~Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.~~
- ~~Write tests to ensure that it works as expected.~~

### ~~Day 3: Reverse String~~
- ~~Write a function to reverse a string.~~
- ~~Write tests for various cases including palindromes and empty strings.~~

### ~~Day 4: Check Palindrome~~
- ~~Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome.~~
- ~~Write tests for this function.~~

### ~~Day 5: FizzBuzz~~
- ~~Implement the classic FizzBuzz problem.~~
- ~~Write tests that check for 'Fizz', 'Buzz', and 'FizzBuzz'.~~

### Day 6: Fibonacci Sequence
- Write a function that returns the `n-th` Fibonacci number.
